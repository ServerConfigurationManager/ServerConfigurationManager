# Server Configuration Manager

Welcome to the Server Configuration Manager project, aka the "DSC for the poor Admin" project.
This is a lightweight configuration deployment toolkit for enterprise environments where you need Desired State Configuration-like capabilities, but are unable to actually move to DSC for one reason or another.

It makes it simple to roll out a central PowerShell repository and applying a desired state in a managed, scaling mnner.

For more details on how to setting up this workflow, see [the documentation](https://ServerConfigurationManager.github.io)
